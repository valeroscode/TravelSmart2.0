# TRAVEL SMART

This project was made with React and uses a large amount of vanilla JS and integrates a non-relational database. 

## Features
<br>
 * Discover hotspots accross multiple cities in the US and abroad. <br>
-Get essential information about places such as opening and closing times, address, phone number, reviews, ratings, and more. <br>
-Create and plan trips, adding places to your trips as you explore or save places to your favorites so they can be added later. <br>
-Looking for a specific kind of place to visit? Such as a Mexican resturant in Miami? Use filters to find exatly what you're looking for. <br>
-Get time and distance estimates from your stay to the places you want to visit using the directions feature in the map. <br>
-As part of your planning, set an overall budget for your trip, individual budgets for each place you visit, your hotel budget, and transportation budget. <br>

## Pages

### `Home Page`
The home page consists of 2 distinct sections:
<br>

#### Home

##### Searchbar
This section is what users see when the page loads. At the top of this section is the header which includes a search bar. <br>
The first search bar handles the category of place you want to search, the second search bar handles the city. 

##### Trips
Trips can be accessed from the home page by clicking 'plan trip'

##### All Places
All places within the website can be seen at the bottom of the home page. From here places can be added to a trip or clicked on if the user wants to be directed to a dedicated page for that place. 

#### Map
<br>
The map has multiple features:

##### Click on a marker or place on the left section for a modal for quick information on the place (such as address, phone, opening times, and more).
##### Click on the filters button to access map filters which allow users to narrow their search. 
For example: Say a user wants to find the more inexpensive coffee shops in Miami that also have a high rating. They would check off Start Your Day, Inexpensive, and Best Rated.

##### Click on "Get Directions" to get time and distance estimates for either walking, biking, or driving from one point to another. 
##### Change the city with the City dropdown menu at the top of the left section. 



The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
